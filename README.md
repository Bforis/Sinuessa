This is the source of the game **Sinuessa** create for the **Game Off 2018** with as Theme "Hybrid".

The goal of this game is to last as long as possible against the boss and its 6 phases of gameplay that speed up over time. Adding to the difficulty, the theme of this game jam was "Hybrid." So, we decided to require players to play together on the same keyboard, being cautious with the keys and coordinating to survive together. In hindsight, it was a rather poor idea.

**Made with Unity.**
